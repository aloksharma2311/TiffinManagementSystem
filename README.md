Our Tiffin Management System ‘डब्बाHUB’is a user-friendly platform built with Java and MySQL, designed to simplify the process of ordering tiffin services. Users can easily sign up or log in, access their profiles, leave feedback, and choose from various tiffin plans like Standard, Premium, Diet, and Family.
Users can choose from weekly, monthly, or quarterly plans, make payments through an integrated payment gateway, and receive a QR code for payment.
The system is connected to multiple databases, ensuring that login information, profile data, feedback, and payments are securely stored and managed.
