Our Tiffin Management System ‘डब्बाHUB’ is a comprehensive, user-friendly platform developed using Java and MySQL to streamline the process of ordering tiffin services. Users can effortlessly sign up, log in, manage their profiles, provide feedback, and select from a variety of tiffin plans including Standard, Premium, Diet, and Family.
With options for weekly, monthly, or quarterly plans, the system allows seamless payments through an integrated gateway, generating a QR code for payment confirmation. The platform securely manages user data across multiple databases, ensuring safe storage of login credentials, profile details, feedback, and payment records—all in one place.
